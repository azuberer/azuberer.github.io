I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Psychiatry, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, USA. I study how self-regulation of attention and emotion is reflected in both behavior and brain activity. My research explores how these processes shape the richness of our subjective experienceâ€”and why some individuals are more vulnerable to mental health challenges than others. To tackle these questions, I use naturalistic stimuli such as movies, combined with methods including functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Electroencephalography (EEG), transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS), and eye-tracking.
