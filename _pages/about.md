I am an Assistant Professor at the Frohlich Laboratory at the Department of Psychiatry, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, USA. I study how self-regulation of attention and emotions manifests both in behavior and in neural signatures. I investigate how these define the rich landscape of our subjective experience to better understand why some people struggle more than others to keep focus - up to a degree when it becomes an attention deficit disorder. I tackle these questions by using naturalistic stimuli like movies together with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Electroencephalography, transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation, and eye-tracking.
