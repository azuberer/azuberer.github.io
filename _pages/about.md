I am the Principal Investigator of the Attention and Affect Laboratory at University TÃ¼bingen, Germany. I am trying to elucidate how self-regulation of attention manifests both in behavior and in neural signatures in the brain. I investigate how our attention defines the rich landscape of our subjective experience to better understand why some people struggle more than others to keep focus - up to a degree when it becomes an attention deficit disorder. What role does self-regulation of attention play when our mind wanders during daydreaming or when we craft new ideas in creative domains? I tackle these questions, by mapping the coherence between behavior and the brain by combining graph, information and control theory.
